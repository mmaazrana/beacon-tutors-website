                    registration fee which needs to be paid for successful registration processing.

                    The Premium package allows the tutors/teachers/resources to complete four
                    projects/assignments/tuitions. This package does not bound the tutors/teachers/resources to apply
                    and work on a specific project/assignment type or niche. e.g. Home Tuitions, Online Tuitions,
                    Freelance work. The tutors/teachers/resources will access the diverse database of
                    tuitions/projects/assignments. However, they can complete only four projects/tasks/assignments. Once
                    the premium package expires, the tutors/teachers/resources cannot renew the package. They can only
                    upgrade the package to ultra-premium.

                    receipt of the amount paid.

                    The various registration packages do not allow the tutors/teachers/resources to have preference over
                    others. It only defines the count of students/parents/clients referred to the

                    predilections. The tutors/teachers/resources can apply for multiple projects, e.g. One can apply for
                    online tuition and a content writing assignment concurrently.

                    unregistered tutor/teacher/resource can inform the verification team about their availability, and

                    that are being asked by the verification team. If the tutor/teacher/resource has any other
                    qualifications, certifications, additional experience or skill that they feel will prove
                    accommodating. In that case, it is advised to the tutors/teachers/resources to provide that

                    or assignment types. All kinds of tuitions/assignments are posted in all groups, irrespective of the
                    categories. The registered tutors/teachers/resources can expect various confirmed tuitions/teaching
                    jobs/assignments in all registered groups. The tuitions/assignments can be in any city, subject,
                    teaching mode (online or home tuition), and freelance content writing type or niche. Registration
                    Preference The tutors/teachers/resources can choose any two subjects in which they are proficient.
                    These will be considered as their preferred subjects. However, this does not circumscribe the
                    tutors/teachers/resources to apply for only the subjects’ tuitions/assignments they have selected.
                    The company will prioritize those tutors/teachers/resources when selecting a candidate for a
                    tuition/assignment who have relevant qualification, experience, and preference. If a tutor/teacher/
                    resource applies for a tuition/assignment that does not match their qualification, experience, or
                    preference, they will be considered a second choice and not the first. They will be only considered
                    if another tutor/teacher/resource with relevant experience, qualification, and preference is not
                    available. The teacher can choose three areas according to their ease of accessibility/traveling.
                    These will be considered as their preferred areas. However, this does not restrict the
                    tutors/teachers/resources to apply for only the tuitions/assignments in the areas they have
                    selected. The preferences are recorded for convenience and used as a filter to narrow down the
                    potential tutors/teachers/resources list in case a large number of applications are received for a
                    specific tuition/assignment. The tutors/teachers/resources can still apply for tuitions/assignments
                    other than their preferred subjects/areas. It does not bound the tutors/teachers/resources to apply
                    for only the tuition/assignments in their selected subjects/areas. In case a tutor/teacher/resource
                    with relevant preferences is not available only then other tutors/teachers/resources are considered
                    for the tuition/assignment.

                    where the tuition/assignment was posted originally only, in this case, the tuition/assignment will

                    It is advised to the tutors/teachers/resources to apply for the tuitions/assignments as soon as

                    The tutor/teacher/resource should check all the conditions and requirements for a specific

                    requirements and agree to all the conditions mentioned by the student/parent/client without any
                    negotiation. The requirements and conditions may include fee offered, time duration, number of
                    weekdays, subjects, and other specifications if the tutor/teacher/resource wants to provide a
                    proposal regarding tuition fee, time duration, number of weekdays or anything else. They should
                    inform their respective group admin about their proposal for the specific tuition/assignment and
                    then apply. The company will forward the tutor’s/teacher’s/resource’s proposal to the concerning
                    student/parent/client for review. If the tutor’s/teacher’s/resource’s profile complements the
                    student’s/parent’s/client’s requirements and the student/parent/client finds the proposal
                    convincing, they may go ahead with it. If the proposal is rejected, then the concerned
                    tutor/teacher/resource may not necessarily get an update on the application, and the company will
                    remove their application from the recommendation list.

                        <li>Set your Hourly Rate or Bid on fixed-priced assignments/projects</li>
                        <li>Write an introductory Cover Letter for the assignment/project</li>
                        <li>Answer any screening questions the client may have asked</li>
                        <li>Provide any relevant work samples to make your proposal stand out</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Some assignments will have a predefined payout. The company will share the assignment details in the
                    registered group, and the interested tutors/teachers/resources who meet the prerequisite and agree
                    to the fixed payout can apply for it.
                </li>
                <li>The tutor/teacher/resource should carefully read all the assignment details before submitting their
                    proposal. Once the tutor/teacher m/resource has placed a bid or submitted the proposal, they will
                    not be able to make any changes to it.
                </li>
                <li>The company takes 15%-25% commission from the total payout of an assignment. The dealing authority
                    will define the exact commission percentage according to the assignment and notify the
                    tutor/teacher/resource.
                </li>
                <li>The tutor/teacher/resource should start working on the assignment after receiving a final
                    acknowledgment notification from the company. The company will send the notification once the deal
                    has been secured and the company has received the payment from the student/parent/client.
                </li>
                <li>The company will define the time frame/deadline, and the tutor/teacher/resource will need to submit
                    the assignment according to the deadline.
                </li>
                <li>The tutor/teacher/resource should be able to deliver accurate, error-free work in the mentioned time
                    frame. The company&#39;s quality assurance team will review the assignment before sending it to the
                    student/parent/client. In case the assignment does not meet the set requirements, the assignment
                    will not be forwarded, and the tutor/teacher/resource will be advised to make the required changes;
                    otherwise, they will not be paid for it. The company will transfer the full payment of the
                    student/parent/client to the student&#39;s/parent&#39;s/client&#39;s e-wallet in this case.
                </li>
                <li>The company can request the tutor/teacher/resource anytime to share the draft (incomplete document)
                    of the assignment to keep track of the work progress.
                </li>
                <li>The company strictly prohibits providing any personal details or contact information by the
                    tutor/teacher/resource in the rough or final draft of the assignment.
                </li>
                <li>The company advises the students/parents/clients to share the full details and requirements for the
                    assignments before it is finalized. If any changes are made to the requirements after it has been
                    started, then the company has the right to decide on the changes in the payout.
                </li>
                <li>It is the responsibility of the student/parent/client to predefine a deadline for the assignment. If
                    a deadline is not predefined, then the student/parent/client cannot request the company to deliver
                    the assignment any day. The company, in this case, will define the deadline.
                </li>
                <li>The student/parent/client can request a draft, and the company will provide them with it. If the
                    student/parent/client finds the draft or final document not aligned to their requirements, then they
                    can request revisions.

                    <p>
                        Revision requests will be accepted for minor changes. If significant changes or additional
                        content is required, then the company will charge extra for it.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <li>If the assignment is not according to the student&#39;s/parent&#39;s/client&#39;s requirements, then
                    they can claim revisions or a refund. In case of refund, the full payment will be transferred to the
                    student&#39;s/parent&#39;s/client&#39;s e-wallet, which can be used by the student/parent/client for
                    any other tuition/assignment in the future.
                </li>
                <li>An E-wallet is a digital tool to keep the money secure and efficiently process transactions within
                    the company. The student/parent/client can use the money saved in their e-wallet anytime to process
                    a transaction when they avail the services of the company.
                </li>
                <li>Consider this as an example. If the student/parent/client makes a payment of $100 for an assignment
                    and the assignment does not turn out to be according to their requirements, then the company will
                    transfer this full amount to the student&#39;s/parent&#39;s/client&#39;s e-wallet. Whenever the
                    student/parent/client needs to get another assignment done, be it for weeks or even months, they can
                    use the amount saved in their e-wallet to make payment for that assignment. The money will remain
                    secure in the e-wallet.

                    responsible for any inconvenience during the application processing, and the student/parent/client
                    will not be able to make a claim.
